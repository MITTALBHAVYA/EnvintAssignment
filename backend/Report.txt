Project Overview:

The Envint Finance Backend API provides a robust platform for financial data processing and risk assessment. It leverages Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Redis to deliver a scalable and efficient solution. The application includes user authentication, data upload, and asynchronous processing via BullMQ workers.

1. Architecture & Flow:

Layered Architecture: The backend follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into routes, controllers, services, models, and configurations.
API Endpoints: RESTful API endpoints handle user authentication, profile management, and financial data operations.
Data Flow:
User requests are routed through Express.js.
Controllers handle business logic, interacting with models and services.
MongoDB stores persistent data (user profiles, financial records).
Redis is used for session management, rate limiting, and job queuing (BullMQ).
BullMQ workers asynchronously process financial data, improving performance and responsiveness.
JWT is used for authentication.
Asynchronous Processing: BullMQ manages a queue for financial data processing. When a user uploads data, a job is created and added to the queue. Workers then process these jobs in the background, allowing the API to remain responsive.
Email Service: Nodemailer is used for password reset emails and potential future communication.
2. Optimization Strategies:

Asynchronous Processing (BullMQ): Offloading financial data processing to background workers significantly improves API responsiveness.
Database Indexing: Proper indexing in MongoDB enhances query performance.
Redis Caching: Redis is used for session management and potentially caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load.
Rate Limiting: express-rate-limit middleware protects the API from abuse and ensures fair resource allocation.
JWT Authentication: JWT provides a stateless and efficient authentication mechanism.
Efficient Error Handling: catchAsyncErrors middleware and a centralized error handler improve code maintainability and provide consistent error responses.
Connection Pooling: Using mongoose and ioredis library provides connection pooling, which reuses database connections.
3. Challenges Faced & Solutions:

Challenge: Asynchronous Data Processing Complexity.
Solution: Implemented BullMQ to manage job queues and workers, providing a reliable and scalable solution for background processing.
Challenge: Ensuring Data Consistency and Integrity.
Solution: Implemented robust data validation using the validator library and enforced schema constraints in MongoDB. Transactions can be implemented in the future if more complex data handling is required.
Challenge: Scalability and Performance.
Solution: Utilized Redis for caching and asynchronous processing, and designed the architecture to be horizontally scalable.
Challenge: Security Vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implemented JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, input validation, and rate limiting to protect against common security threats.
Challenge: Environment Variable Management.
Solution: Used dotenv to manage environment variables, ensuring secure and flexible configuration.
Challenge: Testing Asynchronous Workers.
Solution: Developed tests for the financialRoutes, and planned to expand testing to the worker processes. Mocking external services will be used to ensure test reliability.
Challenge: Handling large financial data uploads.
Solution: File streaming and buffering can be used, as well as splitting the upload into smaller chunks, to prevent memory issues.
